<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About

As a French citizen, the election periods are always great moments. Television only talks about this, everyone has his analysis and it often ends up in a big argument between left-wingers, right-wingers and those who don't care.

Trought this project,  I want to provide an analysis of French elections results for people like me who became allergic to media  and their fruitless discussions.
This  work is not intended to influence the choices of anyone and does not contain any information about my own convictions. It is not a political analysis but an objective presentation of the data of these events.

And to make it a little more interesting, I will try to see if there are any correlations to determine the choice of a part of the population.
This part is intended to be more entertaining than rigorous, but maybe we will find some suprises
